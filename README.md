# Fastai-Dialogue/narative machine learning
This repository is used to scrape dialogue and narrative portions of the greatest literary works in the world, then use machine learning to create computer generated dialogue and narrative.

The Dialogue and Narrative files are a bit too large to post on GitHub, so you'll have to run the 'bookWebScrape' csv generator first.

You will find detailed explanations within each notebook file.
